# USDA-Webscraper

Jupyter notebook using BeautifulSoup and Requests to query the [USDA REEIS project site](https://reeis.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/).

Due to potential issues with internet, or access to the REEIS website, some code added to write project numbers and corresponding link in the website to a CSV whenever a query fails.

Resulting output is around 100MB, and cannot be directly hosted on Github.
